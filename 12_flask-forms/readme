DISCO:
     - a 'GET' request uses request.args
     - a 'POST' request uses request.form
     - forcing a 'POST' request -- you must include method = 'post' in the opening <form> tag
     - when forcing a 'POST' request, all references to response.args must be changed to response.form

QCC:
     - Why do we have to force a 'POST' request, but not a 'GET' request?
