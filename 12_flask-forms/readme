    38 - request is module, how can we print it?
    41 - what is args? arguments provided to module?
    43 - is request.args an array? based on [] usage in print statement
    45 - prints the type then submitted username

         print(request.args['username'])
    49 - 
    51 - all are print statements, so should show up in the terminal
         loads another page?
    56 - confusing route link, still has old route even if both are changed?
