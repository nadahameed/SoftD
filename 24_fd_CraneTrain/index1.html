              <p>Once upon a time two duckies named Bob and Ray met. Ray was playing hackee-sack with his friends when Bob ran up and shoved him.
              What are you doing to my family!!! Ray and his friends had accidentally assaulted Bob's family, badly injuring his son
              and traumatizing his wife. Bob was very angry. He told Ray the only way he could make it up to them would to be to venture to
              top of a magical mountain to get a stone to heal his son. Ray felt so bad he agreed. After facing many challenges and obtacles on his climb
              Ray finally made it to the top of the mountain. As he reached for the stone Bob grabbed him from behind and pulled him away.
              This had all been part of Bob's evil plan to have Ray face all the obstacles on the mountain so that he could get the stone easily.
              With the stone (which could also make gold), Bob would make a fortune. Bob was threatening Ray and he didn't know what to do.</p>
